% When using greek input like α it apparently tries to use the command
% \textalpha, which doesn't exist. So I redefine all such commands.  One problem
% is that some packages do define some commands (e.g. hyperref defines \textbeta
% and \textmu), in which case I need to \renew instead. Possibly this will break
% such pacakages; what I probably need to set them to be is commands which work
% in either math or text mode.

% I use \varphi and \varepsilon because I like them better, because the font I
% use displays those variants, and to save typing when I have to use whichever
% one isn't used here.
