* Definitions

- Fuchsian group :: A discrete group of orientation preserving isometries of $ℍ$. Called /of the first kind/ if its limit set is $∂ℍ$, and /of the second kind/ otherwise.
- Limit set :: The limit set of a fuchsian group $G$ is the closure (under the Euclidean topology on $∂ℍ$) of the set of non-elliptic fixed points of elements of $G$.

* Theorems

** Limit sets

- If $G$ is fuchsian with limit set $Λ$, then
  - $Λ$ is closed and $G$-invariant.
  - $|Λ| ≤ 2$ iff $G$ is elementary. Otherwise $|Λ| = ∞$.
  - Every $G$-orbit is dense in $Λ$ (i.e.\nbsp{}$Λ$ is minimal in the sense that it has no proper closed $G$-invariant subsets).
  - If $G$ is non-elementary, then $Λ$ is uncountable, closed and has no isolated points.
  - If $G$ is of the second kind, $Λ$ is nowhere dense in $∂𝔻$.
  - For any $x ∈ \overline{𝔻}$, $Λ$ is the set of accumulation points of $G⋅x$.
- Corollary: if $G$ is of the second kind, its limit set is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
