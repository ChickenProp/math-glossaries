* Notation

- $\crossrat z$ :: The cross-ratio $\frac{z_1-z_2}{z_1-z_3}‚ãÖ\frac{z_4-z_3}{z_4-z_2}$, $z_i ‚àà \chat$.
- $\aut(S)$ :: The group of conformal bijections $f:S ‚Üí S$.
- $\ax(f)$ :: When $f ‚àà \aut(‚Ñô)$ is hyperbolic, its axis $\ax(f)$ is the geodesic between its fixed points.
- $\chat$ :: The Riemann sphere $‚ÑÇ ‚à™ \set{‚àû}$.
- $C$ :: The Cayley transform $‚Ñç ‚Üí ùîª: C(z) = \frac{z-i}{z+i}$. A conformal isometry.
- $‚Ñô$ :: We use this when a statement applies to both $‚Ñç$ and $ùîª$.

* Definitions

- Accumulation point :: $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$ if every neighbourhood of $x$ intersects $S\smallsetminus\{x\}$. (We may have $x ‚àâ S$.)
- Circle :: On $\chat$, a "circle" might also be a straight line. Similarly, "concyclic" elements might be colinear.
- Conformal :: A conformal map $‚ÑÇ ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ$ is one which preserves angles.
- Discrete :: $G ‚â§ \gsl2R$ is discrete if it has no accumulation points in $\gsl2R$.
- Elementary :: A fuchsian group $G$ is elementary if it is cyclic generated by a parabolic, hyperbolic, or a finite-order elliptic; or $G = ‚ü®T, S | S^2 = 1, STS = T^{-1}‚ü©$ where $T$ is hyperbolic (and $S$ is necessarily elliptic).
- Free :: A group $G$ acts freely on $Œ©$ if $g‚ãÖx = x ‚áí g = 1$.
- Fuchsian group :: A discrete group of orientation preserving isometries of $‚Ñç$. Called /of the first kind/ if its limit set is $‚àÇ‚Ñç$, and /of the second kind/ otherwise.
- Fundamental domain :: $R ‚äÇ ‚Ñç$ is a fundamental domain for a fuchsian group $G$ if all $g(R)$ are disjoint, and the $g(\overline{R})$ cover $‚Ñç$. We usually also assume that $\overline{R}$ is convex; $‚àÇR ‚à© ‚Ñç$ is a countable union of geodesic segments, of which only finitely many meet any compact set in $‚Ñç$; and only finitely many $g(R)$ meet any compact set in $‚Ñç$.
- Isometry :: An isometry $f:M‚ÜíM'$ is a bijection of metric spaces such that $d_M(x,y) = d_{M'}(f(x), f(y))$. It is /orientation preserving/ if $\det Df(x) > 0$ for all $x ‚àà M$ ($Df$ is the Jacobian).
- Limit set :: The limit set of a fuchsian group $G$ is the closure (under the Euclidean topology on $‚àÇ‚Ñç$) of the set of non-elliptic fixed points of elements of $G$.
- Linear fractional transformation :: An LFT is a map $f : \chat ‚Üí \chat$ of the form $f(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ where $a,b,c,d ‚àà ‚ÑÇ$ and $ad-bc ‚â† 0$. We say $f(‚àû) = a/c$, and $x/0 = ‚àû$. Let $t = \tr \mat abcd$. Then $f$ is called *parabolic* if $t = ¬±2$; *hyperbolic* if $t ‚àà ‚Ñù$ and $|t| > 2$; *elliptic* if $t ‚àà ‚Ñù$ and $|t| < 2$; and *loxodromic* if $t ‚àâ ‚Ñù$.
- Properly discontinuous :: $G$ acts properly discontinously on $‚Ñç$ if for every compact $K ‚äÇ H$, $|\set{g ‚àà G: g(K) ‚à© K ‚â† \varnothing}| < ‚àû$.
- Side :: If $R$ is a convex polygon and a fundamental domain for $G$, a side of $R$ is a maximal geodesic segment $S ‚äÇ ‚àÇR$ of positive length, such that for some $g ‚àà G$, $S ‚äÇ \overline{R} ‚à© g(\overline{R})$. This $g$ is called the associated side pairing transformation.
- Topological group :: A group which is also a topological space, in which multiplication and inversion are continuous.

* Theorems

** Linear fractional transformations

- There is a surjective homomorphism $F: \ggl2C ‚Üí \aut(\chat): \mat abcd ‚Üí (z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d})$, with kernel $\set{ŒªI : Œª ‚àà ‚ÑÇ^√ó}$.
- Any LFT is a composition of
  - Translations :: $\mat 1t01: z \mapsto z+t$
  - Rotations :: $\mat*{e^{iŒ∏} & -ae^{iŒ∏} \\ 0 & 1}: z \mapsto e^{iŒ∏}(z-a)+a$
  - Scaling :: $\mat {Œª}001: z \mapsto Œªz$
  - Inversion :: $\mat 0110: z \mapsto 1/z$
- $\aut(\chat)$ acts transitively and freely on ordered triples of distinct points in $\chat$.
- The cross-ratio is invariant under $\aut(\chat)$: if $T ‚àà \aut(\chat)$ then $\crossrat{z} = \crossrat{Tz}$.
- Distinct $z_1, ‚Ä¶, z_4 ‚àà \chat$ are concyclic iff $\crossrat z ‚àà ‚Ñù$.
- Corollary: $\aut(\chat)$ maps circles to circles.
- $\aut(ùîª)$ contains maps of the form $e^{iŒ∏}\mat*{1 & -a \\ -\bar{a} & -1}$ where $a ‚àà ùîª$; or $\mat*{a & b \\ \bar{b} & \bar{a}}$ where $|a|^2 - |b|^2 = 1$.
- $\aut(‚Ñç)$ contains maps of the form $\mat abcd ‚àà \ggl2R$ with positive determinant.

** Basics of hyperbolic Geometry

- On $ùîª$, we have the metric $\dd s^2 = \frac{4(\dd x^2 + \dd y^2)}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2}$.
- On $‚Ñç$, we have the metric $\dd s^2 = \frac{\dd x^2 + \dd y^2}{y^2}$.
- The Gauss curvature of both these metrics is $-1$.
- On $‚Ñç$, vertical lines are geodesics, and if $b ‚â• a$ then $d_‚Ñç(ai, bi) = \ln(b/a)$. Other geodesics are arcs of circles with centres on $‚Ñù$.
- On $ùîª$, radial lines are geodesics, and $d_ùîª(0, z) = \ln(\frac{1+z}{1-z})$. Other geodesics are arcs of circles that cross $‚àÇùîª$ at right angles.
- $\isomp(‚Ñô)$ acts transitively on pairs of equidistant points in $‚Ñô$, and on cyclically ordered triples of points on $‚àÇ‚Ñô$.
- $\aut(‚Ñô) = \isomp(‚Ñô)$.
- Circles in $‚Ñô$ and $‚Ñç$ are circles in the Euclidian metric, but the centres in general do not agree.
- If a circle in $ùîª$ has Euclidean radius $œÅ$, then it has hyperbolic radius $R = \ln(\frac{1+p}{1-p})$ and hyperbolic area $4œÄ\sinh^2(R/2)$.
- If $P, P' ‚àà ‚Ñô$ and $Q, Q' ‚àà ‚àÇ‚Ñô$ such that $Q-P-P'-Q'$ is a geodesic (with $Q$ adjacent to $P$ and $Q'$ adjacent to $P'$, then $d_‚Ñô(P, P') = \ln([Q, P', P, Q'])$.
- If $z_1, z_2 ‚àà ‚Ñç$, then $\cosh d_‚Ñç(z_1, z_2) = 1 + \frac{|z_1 - z_2|^2}{2\Im z_1 \Im z_2}$.
- If $z_1, z_2 ‚àà ùîª$, then $\tanh d_ùîª(z_1, z_2) = \frac{|z_1 - z_2|}{|1 - \bar{z_1}z_2|}$.
- Given a point $P$ and a line $L$, there is a unique perpendicular $K$ from $P$ to $L$, and this minimises $d(P,L)$. If $L'$ is a line through $P$ tangent to $L$ (sharing an endpoint) and $Œ∏$ is the angle $KPL'$, then $\cosh d(P,L) = 1/\sin(Œ∏)$.
- Given lines $L$ and $L'$ which do not meet even on $‚àÇP$, there is a unique common perpendicular, and this minimises distance.
- Given a line $L$ and points $Y, Y'$, project perpendiculars to $X, X' ‚àà L$. Then $d(Y, Y') > d(X, X')$ unless $Y, Y' ‚àà L$.
- In $‚Ñç$, a curve $C$ equidistant from a line $L$ is an arc of a circle through the endpoints of $L$. If $L$ is a vertical, then $C$ is a ray with the same base as $L$.
- The angle sum of a hyperbolic $n$-gon is strictly less than $(n-2)œÄ$.
- The area of a hyperbolic $n$-gon is $(n-2)œÄ - (\text{angle sum})$.
- Triangle congruence tests: SSS, SAS, ASA and AAA all work.
- Given three angles summing to less than $œÄ$, there is a triangle with those angles.
- Consider a triangle with sides length $a,b,c$ opposite angles $Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥$ respectively.
  - Hyperbolic pythagorean theorem: if $Œ≥ = œÄ/2$, then $\cosh c = \cosh a \cosh b$. Further, $a + b ‚â§ c + \cosh^{-1}(2)$.
  - Hyperbolic trigonometry: $\sin Œ≤ = \frac{\sinh b}{\sinh c}$, $\cos Œ± = \frac{\tanh a}{\tanh c}$.
  - Sinh rule: $\frac{\sinh a}{\sin Œ±} = \frac{\sinh b}{\sin Œ≤} = \frac{\sinh c}{\sin Œ≥}$.
  - Cosh rule 1: $\cos Œ≥ = \frac{\cosh a \cosh b - \cosh c}{\sinh a \sinh b}$.
  - Cosh rule 2: $\cosh c = \frac{\cos Œ± \cos Œ≤ + \cos Œ≥}{\sin Œ± \sin Œ≤}$.

** Isometries of $ùîª$ and $‚Ñç$

- If $f ‚àà \aut(‚Ñô)$ is palindromic, it has one fixed point $z_0$ on $‚àÇ‚Ñô$. It maps horocycles (circles tangent to $‚Ñù$ at $z_0$) onto themselves; and maps geodesics with an endpoint at $z_0$ onto each other. In $‚Ñç$, if $z_0 = ‚àû$, $f$ is a translation $z \mapsto z + Œ≤$ for some $Œ≤ ‚àà ‚Ñù$.
- If $f ‚àà \aut(‚Ñô)$ is hyperbolic, it has two fixed points on $‚àÇ‚Ñô$, $z_-$ (repelling) and $z_+$ (attracting). It maps lines equidistant from $\ax(f)$ onto themselves.
- If $f ‚àà \aut(‚Ñô)$ is elliptic, it has one fixed point $z_0$ in $‚Ñô$. It maps circles centred on $z_0$ onto themselves.
- A hyperbolic isometry $f$ is conjugate to some $T ‚àà \aut(‚Ñç): T(z) = Œªz$, with fixed points $0$ and $‚àû$. $Œª$ is called the multiplier of $f$. For $x ‚àà \ax(f)$, we have $d(x, T(x)) = \ln Œª =: l$. For general $z ‚àà ‚Ñô$, $\sinh \frac{d(z, T(z))}{2} = \sinh \frac{l}{2} \cosh \frac{d(z, \ax(f))}{2}$.
- If $L$ is any geodesic, there is a unique orientation-reversing isometry $œÉ$ such that $œÉ^2 = 1$, $œÉ|_L = 1$, and $d(x, L) = d(œÉ(x), L)$.
- Any $f ‚àà \aut(‚Ñô)$ can be written as a product of two such reflections. It is hyperbolic if the lines don't intersect, parabolic if they intersect on $‚àÇ‚Ñô$, and elliptic if they intersect in $‚Ñô$.
- Any nonabelian subgroup of $\aut(‚Ñô)$ contains hyperbolic elements.


** Groups of orientation-preserving isometries

- $\gsl2R$ and $\psl2R$ are topological groups.
- If $G ‚â§ \gsl2R$, TFAE:
  - $G$ has no accumulation points in $G$.
  - $G$ has no accumulation points in $\gsl2R$.
  - $\mat 1001$ is an isolated point in $G$.
- If $G ‚â§ \gsl2R$, TFAE:
  - $G$ does not act properly discontinously on $‚Ñç$.
  - Some $G$-orbit in $‚Ñç$ has accumulation points in $‚Ñç$.
  - All $G$-orbits in $‚Ñç$ have accumulation points in $‚Ñç$, with the possible exception of one point fixed by all $g ‚àà G$.
- If $G$ acts properly discontinuously on $‚Ñç$, $G$ is discrete.
- If $G < \aut(‚Ñô)$ is abelian and discrete, and $T ‚àà G$ is either elliptic or parabolic, then $G = ‚ü®T‚ü©$ is cyclic.
- Any discrete subgroup of $\aut(‚Ñô)$ is cyclic.
- If $K ‚äÇ ‚Ñç$ is compact, then $E = \set{T ‚àà \aut(‚Ñç) : T(i) ‚àà K}$ is compact in $\aut(‚Ñç)$.
- If $G$ is discrete, it acts properly discontinously on $‚Ñç$.
- If $G$ is discrete and infinite, then every orbit has accumulation points on $‚àÇ‚Ñç$.
- $G$ fuchsian, $h, g ‚àà G$ with $h$ hyperbolic. Then either $g$ is hyperbolic with the same fixed points as $h$, or no fixed point of $h$ is also a fixed point of $g$.
- If $g, h ‚àà \aut(‚Ñç)$, $g$ elliptic or parabolic, with no fixed points shared. Then $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ is hyperbolic.
- $G$ fuchsian, $h,g ‚àà G$ with $h$ hyperbolic and $g(\ax(h)) ‚â† \ax(h)$. Then $G$ contains infinitely many hyperbolic elements, all with distinct axes.
- $G$ fuchsian. TFAE:
  - $G$ elementary.
  - There is $H ‚â§ G$ abelian with $[G:H]$ finite.
  - There is a finite $G$-orbit in $\overline{‚Ñç}$.
- If $G$ is fuchsian, $\mat 1101 ‚àà G$ and $\mat abcd ‚àà G$, then either $c = 0$ or $|c| ‚â• 1$.
- *J√∏rgensen's inequality* If $A,B$ in a non-elementary fuchsian group, then $|\tr^2(A) - 4| + |\tr(ABA^{-1}B^{-1}) - 2| ‚â• 1$.

** Fundamental domains, side pairings and the cycle condition

- We can construct a fundamental domain for any fuchsian group $G$ as follows: choose any $z_0 ‚àà ‚Ñç$ which is not fixed by any $G$. For $g ‚àà G$, define $H_g(z_0) = \set{ z ‚àà ‚Ñç: d(z, z_0) < d(z, g(z_0)) }$. Then $R(z_0) = \bigcap_{g ‚àà G\setminus\set{1}}H_g(z_0)$ is a fundamental domain, satisfying the extra assumptions.
- Let $G$ be fuchsian, $R$ a fundamental convex polygon, and $G_0 < G$ a collection of side pairings which together pair all the sides of $R$. Then $G_0$ is a set of generators for $G$.
- Choose a vertex $v_0$ of a fundamental polygon $R$. Draw a small path around $v$, and label the regions that it meets clockwise by $R = h_0R, h_1R, ‚Ä¶ h_{k-1}R, h_kR = R$. Then each $h_i^{-1}h_{i+1}$ is a side pairing, so $\prod{i=0}^{k-1}(h_i^{-1}h_{i+1}) = 1$ gives a relation of side pairings. If we do this for all vertices, the relations we get together with the generators $G_0$ form a presentation for $G$.
- Let $g_i$ be the side pairing of the side preceding $v_i$ clockwise, and $v_{i+1} = g_i(v_i)$. This gives us a relation $(g_{k-1}‚Ä¶g_1g_0)^p = 1$ for some $p$.
- If $R$ has a single vertex in $‚àÇ‚Ñç$, then $g_{k-1}‚Ä¶g_0$ is parabolic.
- If $R$ has two vertices in $‚àÇ‚Ñç$, then either $g_{k-1}‚Ä¶g_0$ is hyperbolic or $G$ is elementary.
- *Poincar√©* Let $R ‚äÇ ‚Ñç$ be a finite sided convex polygon, with sides paired by $g_1,‚Ä¶,g_k$. Suppose that for each cycle associated to an interior vertex, the angle sum is $2œÄ/p$ for some $p ‚àà ‚Ñï$, and for any ideal vertex the associated cycle product is parabolic. Then $G = ‚ü®g_1,‚Ä¶,g_k‚ü©$ is fuchsian, $R$ is a fundamental domain, and the cycle relations give a presentation for $G$.
- If $G$ is fuchsian and non-elementary, it has a subgroup isomorphic to the free group on two elements.

** Limit sets

- If $G$ is fuchsian with limit set $Œõ$, then
  - $Œõ$ is closed and $G$-invariant.
  - $|Œõ| ‚â§ 2$ iff $G$ is elementary. Otherwise $|Œõ| = ‚àû$.
  - Every $G$-orbit is dense in $Œõ$ (i.e.\nbsp{}$Œõ$ is minimal in the sense that it has no proper closed $G$-invariant subsets).
  - If $G$ is non-elementary, then $Œõ$ is uncountable, closed and has no isolated points.
  - If $G$ is of the second kind, $Œõ$ is nowhere dense in $‚àÇùîª$.
  - For any $x ‚àà \overline{ùîª}$, $Œõ$ is the set of accumulation points of $G‚ãÖx$.
- Corollary: if $G$ is of the second kind, its limit set is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
